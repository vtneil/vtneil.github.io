have **3 days** to finish.

The quiz has maximum score of 100.

* Part A: **30**

The total score is calculated at maximum of 100 points:

I highly recommend you to practice a lot. 
The practice problems will guide you on how you would write a program. 
The quiz will be similar to homework assignment problems.
