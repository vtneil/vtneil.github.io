# Assignment 1.3: Self-study

## Boolean operations

Boolean operations are similar to arithmetic 
operations, but in a logical way.

Remind that Boolean data types have only two possible value: `True` or `False`.

In logic, there is AND, OR, IMPLIES, and EQUIVALENCE operators.

In Python, these rules apply as well, and in similar fashion, the syntax (symbol) 
of these operators make sense!

<table style="width: 100%">
<tr>
<th>A</th>
<th>not A</th>
<th>B</th>
<th>A and B</th>
<th>A or B</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>False</td>
<td>True</td>
<td>False</td>
<td>False</td>
<td>False</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>False</td>
<td>True</td>
<td>True</td>
<td>False</td>
<td>True</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>True</td>
<td>False</td>
<td>False</td>
<td>False</td>
<td>True</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>True</td>
<td>False</td>
<td>True</td>
<td>True</td>
<td>True</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Comparison operators

There are several comparison operators
1. Equal to `a == b`: returns True if `a` equals `b`.
2. Not equal to `a != b`
3. Strictly less than `a < b`
4. Less than or equal to `a <= b`
5. Strictly greater than `a > b`
6. Greater than or equal to `a >= b`
